# Pop-Up-and-Display

In this Application there is one Text view where we can write anything as per user want and according to this Two Button are created there 
1. Click (for Pop up the entered message )
2. Show  (for Display the entered message below the interface) 

This is the basic application where we get to know the content provider and the The Pop-Up message, how to use in very simple way.
Easy to use and reliable to install and use in any application.


Thank you.
